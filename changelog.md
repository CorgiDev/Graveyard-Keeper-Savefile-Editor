0.1.5
=====

Fixed:

* A mistake on my side which partly breaks your save file, which was introduced in 9c8be820dba71381a4e4fce4ed64813a39881400 - It is only a small change but an own release because it breaks save files. If your save file was broken by this bug, leave me a message because the fix is rather simple (it is just adding a byte at a specific location).

 
0.1.4
=====

Added:
 * Support for modifying NPC Relationship values
